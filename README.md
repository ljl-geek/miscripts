miscripts
=========

Miscellaneous scripts and plugins that I want to share

I have also put some of these into miscTemplates. I should merge the repos...

nag-scripts
-----------
Various simple nagios/icinga plugin scripts

pnp4nag_php
-----------
These are the pnp4nagios "template" php files that match some extant nagios/icinga plugins

script_templates
----------------
I hate starting from scratch, so I have simple templates to C+P

clues
-----
The are clues, one-liners and notes, collected and sanitized. Seriously, I add little stuff here a lot, plus snark

dotfiles
--------
Some old dotfiles. I have more, I just need to find them and check them in

ToDo
-------------
Dig up aliases, etc from my last gig and add them
