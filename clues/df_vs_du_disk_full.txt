Uh, Oh!

The nagios process is holding a deleted log file open and is still writing to it

Problem solved

apparently when the mod_gearman log rotates, it doesn't hup the nagios process

The clue was that the sizes of the directories and files on the /var/log partition were less than the space taken up shown in df, which means that a deleted file was still being held open by a process.  sudo lsof | grep /var/log shows the files that are open, what process has them open, and how big they are on disk
