While I probably didn't get the job, I had some fun delving into some of 
the more obscure parts of xargs (Binary tree sort, really? Do I look 
like a CS RCG?)

Every one has seen stuff like:

find ./ -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +360 -exec rm {} \;

Well, xargs uses '{}' to stuff its aray into as well

Plus, it can use -P# o do shit in parallel

So you can do:

ls | xargs -I'{}' bash -c 'grep foo {}; grep bar {}'

ls | xargs -I '{}' bash -c 'echo "====="; echo {} ; echo "-----" ; grep ljl {}' 

Plus, if you have a lot of stuff to do, like run the same ssh command on 
lots of hosts, you can set parallelizarion with -P and a number

If it craps out because you argument list is too big, use -s with a 
suitably large number.

(I swear xargs didn't have this stuff when I first learned it, but that 
shows me that I need to re-read man pages every few years just to see 
what's changed.)
