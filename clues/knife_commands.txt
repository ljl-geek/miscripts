Knife commands

## example of node search ohai time
dfoo exec -E 'nodes.search("name:d09824isp1*") {|n| puts "#{n.name} => " "#{Time.at(n[:ohai_time])}"}'
d09824isp1.stores.example.com => 2015-03-25 06:11:10 -0700

## example of search for non-converging nodes, json output
pphx search node 'NOT (fqdn:[a TO z] OR name:nagios*)' -Fj -i

### NOTE: nodes that don't converge will not appear in standard search, because we
### whack them during chef execution of gapNagiosServer so they don't build and break
### so you can't look for bad recipes that way

##attribute to knife:
-a nagiosconfig.node
pfoo node show nagios001.foo.example.com -a nagiosconfig.node -F json
pfoo node show nagios001.foo.example.com -a nagiosconfig -F json
pfoo node show nagios001.foo.example.com -a nagiosconfig.base -F json

## how is our convergence
for i in {1..6};do knife exec -E 'nodes.search("name:nagios* OR name:*mtk* OR name:gearman* OR name:printing* OR name:snmp") {|n| unless n[:ohai_time].nil?; puts "#{n.name} => " "#{Time.at(n[:ohai_time])}"; else puts "#{n.name} => No Ohai_Time data found for this host";end}' -s https://chef0${i}.foo.example.com;done | ack -r '001|002|10[0-4]|mtk|gear|print|snmp' | ack -v 'No' | sort
