Need to add our uid's in /deploy/svn-example/example/hooks/commit-access-control.cfg file.

rakesh [15:05]
I wasted one whole afternoon to figure that out :grinning:

seth [15:10] 
Ah, cool.

seth [15:11]15:11
@rakesh: The SOP says to clone a job.  I don't see any references to cloning on the web.  Can I assume that "copy" is what the SOP should say?

rakesh [15:11] 
Yup..i was looking for the clone option too last time. Then i realized that we have to copy it.

seth [15:12] 
And you did that by going to "new job" from the jenkins main page?

rakesh [15:13] 
yes

rakesh [15:13]
Go to trunk_deployable and then create "new job"

seth [15:14] 
what do you mean, go to trunk_deployable?

rakesh [15:14] 
Sorry..Sprint releases

rakesh [15:14]
* example releases

seth [15:15] 
Is that "create job" link different from the one on the main page?

seth [15:15]
sorry "new job"

seth [15:15]
yes, I see it is.

rakesh [15:16] 
Yes. If you create in the main page, it will go under ALL.

rakesh [15:18] 
Cool. Thx Seth!

rakesh [15:19]15:19
Seth, For web client Jenkins job. You need to copy the job "Sprint31_web-client_release" to "Sprint32_web-client_release"

seth [15:20] 
OK, thanks!

rakesh [15:21] 
You need to change Repository URL to Sprint32 and Build number to "BUILD_NUMBER=spa32.${BUILD_NUMBER}"

If you don't like ransom notes (which perl programs may become over time) use this trick: get perl to reformat the code with a this command:

     perl -MO=Deparse ransom.pl >better.pl

You're going to think I'm a joker (you might say: the answer is a joke), but here goes anyway:

    Select your Confluence RTE contents (in Windows, press Ctrl+A) and copy it to the clipboard (Ctrl+C).
    Paste the contents (Ctrl+V) into Wikifier RT. (http://www.amnet.net.au/~ghannington/confluence/wikifier/rt/)
    In Wikifier RT, click Show HTML.
    Copy the ("plain text") source from the HTML pane to a text editor (for example, Notepad), and save it (say, in a .txt file).
    Later (seconds, days, whatever), copy the saved HTML source back into the HTML pane of Wikifier RT.
    Click Update rich text.
    Copy the contents of the Rich text pane into the Confluence RTE.

To make http_remote_user go to remote_user via proxy server
On the proxy: 
    RewriteEngine On
   RequestHeader set REMOTE_USER %{REMOTE_USER}s

   RewriteRule .* - [E=PROXY_USER:%{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}] # note mod_rewrite's lookahead option
   RequestHeader set Proxy-User %{PROXY_USER}e

On the actual host:

(before the directory stuff)
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Proxy-user} ^(.*)$
RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%1]

@ljl: @seth : To make insights work on firefox

prateekkakirwar [17:06]
do this
enter about:config into the firefox address bar
set network.negotiate-auth.allow-insecure-ntlm-v1 to true
this will again prompt you for insight username and password
once you can open insights
you can go ahead again set this property to false
you might need to keep it set to true for it to work

Oh for the love of $DIETY, I can't cut and paste from an F5 data list.  I guess I'll try to find the data on the F5 via command line.

b list | less -- searched for restapi_trusted_conn.  found my list.

Using the union of both data group lists with cto_gateway in them: 
[seth@lb2:Active] ~ # b list | grep cto_gateway
class trusted_cto_gateway_clients {
class trusted_cto_gateway_ip {
